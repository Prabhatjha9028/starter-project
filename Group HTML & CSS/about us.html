        G-Shock is a line of watches manufactured by Casio, designed to resist mechanical shock and vibration. Its full form is Gravitational Shock. They are designed primarily for sports, military and outdoors-oriented activities nearly all G-shocks are digital or a combination of analog and digital and have a stopwatch feature, countdown timer, electroluminescent backlight and water resistance.
    </p>
    <h2><b>History</b></h2>
    <p>
        In 1983, Casio engineer Kikuo Ibe designed the first G-Shock: the DW-5000C.It had a 10-year battery life, water resistance to 10 bar and was able to survive a 10 meter fall onto a hard surface (he tested 200 prototypes by dropping them from rooftops or third story windows).<br>

        The shock resistant design has 10 layers protecting the quartz timekeeping module, including a urethane rubber bumper, the stainless steel case, the hardened mineral glass watch crystal, the stainless steel screwed down caseback, and the "floating module" where the quartz mechanism floats free in a urethane foam cradle, with the outer buttons and LCD module attached with flexible cables.<br>

        Casio released the G-Shock in April 1983, to fill the demand for durable watches. The popularity of G-Shocks increased throughout the 1990s. By 1998 Casio released over 200 G-Shock models. By then Casio had sold 19 million G-Shocks worldwide.<br>

         In 1991, Casio released the Baby-G series for women.

         G-Shock Mini are 70% the size of a G-Shock, for people who have smaller wrists. They are available in Japan and can be shipped worldwide.

         On September 1, 2017, Casio celebrated its 100 millionth shipment of G-Shocks worldwide.

   <h2><b>Current models</b></h2>
   <p>
       The line of watches now includes atomic clock synchronization and solar battery. The Cockpit Series G-Shock is the official timekeeper of Nismo Racing. Many newer G-Shocks feature metal (steel or titanium) banding and analog timekeeping.<br>
       DW are standard G-Shocks while GW G-Shocks comes in either Tough Solar or Atomic or both.<br>
       Twice a year the basic models are updated. New limited models are introduced more frequently through the year. As with Swatch watches, G-Shocks have become collectors items.<br>
       Casio also produces collaboration models, often with popular fashion brands, like A Bathing Ape (Bape), Stussy,[7] Xlarge, KIKS TYO, Nano Universe, Levi's, Lifted Research Group, as well as Coca Cola, Pulp68 Skateshop, Lucky Strike and Marlboro.<br>
       G-Shock watches are popular with mountaineers, firefighters, paramedics, people working in the offshore, police officers, astronauts, film directors (Tony Scott was often pictured wearing a GW-3000B, as is Ron Howard and Francis Ford Coppola) and soldiers. Ex-Special Forces-British SAS soldier Andy McNab mentions in several of his novels how his character Nick Stone relies on a G-Shock watch. According to Mark Bowden's book Blackhawk Down, the DELTA Operators wore G-Shock watches during the combat events of 3 & 4 October 1993. Since then, G-Shock watches have become very popular with Special Forces groups in both American and other NATO nation units, due to their being "battle tested".<br>
       Models DW-5600C, DW-5600E, DW-5900, DW-6600, DW-6900 are flight-qualified for NASA space travel.[8] Casio has updated the DW-5600E module, replacing the usual 1545 module with module number 3229 (in 2010).<br>
       In 2012, Casio released GB-6900, a Bluetooth-capable model of G-Shock. Casio claimed the battery life of 2 years on a single CR2032 battery.<br>
       Casio continues to add new features to G-Shock watches. Some include Tough Solar battery charging and Multiband 6 time synchronization through radio signals from six transmission stations worldwide. The GW-9400 Rangeman and GWN-1000 Gulfmaster models have a Triple Sensor with a digital compass, thermometer, and barometer/altimeter. The MTG-S1000, GW-A1000, and GPW-1000 feature Triple G Resist which includes resistance to shock, centrifugal gravity, and vibration. In 2014, Casio introduced the GPS Hybrid Wave Ceptor feature in the GPW-1000 Gravitymaster that allows the watch to synchronize the time through GPS signals and also adjusts the time zone automatically. The MRG-G1000 is also equipped with this feature.[citation needed]<br>
       In September 2018, to mark the 35th anniversary of G-Shock, Casio released a collection of four clear model of G-Shock watches called "The Glacier Gold" collection.<br>

   <h2><b>Atomic Clock Sync with Multi-Band 6</b></h2>
   <p>
       G-Shock watches with Multi-Band 6 can tune into an atomic clock for automatic time keeping.<br>
       There are currently six radio towers around the world:<br>
       <h3><b>Japan</b></h3>
       Watches can tune in to two locations:<br>
       The 40 kHz signal from JJY at Mount Otakadoya, near Fukushima (Ohtakadoyayama).<br>
       The 60 kHz signal from the Haganeyama Transmitter at Mount Hagane (Haganeyama).<br>
       <h3><b>China</b></h3>
       Watches tune to the 68 kHz signal from BPC at Shangqiu. This is the newest additional signal; older multi-band 5 watches will not be able to connect to this signal, and must be upgraded to a newer multi-band 6 watch for it to work.
       <h3><b>United States</b></h3>
       Watches tune to the 60 kHz signal from WWVB at Fort Collins.
       <h3><b>United Kingdom</b></h3>
       Watches tune to the 60 kHz MSF at Anthorn.
       <h3><b>Germany</b></h3>
       Watches tune to the 77.5 kHz low frequency time signal radio station DCF77 at Mainflingen.

      <h2><b>Guinness World Record Title</b></h2>
      <p>
          On December 12, 2017, G-Shock has earned the Guinness World Record for the heaviest vehicle to drive over a watch. Guinness World Record drove a 24.97 ton truck over the Casio G-Shock DW5600E-1. The G-Shock is the first watch by any company being able to withstand the challenge.
